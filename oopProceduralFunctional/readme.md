Before we start to write our code, we have to ask ourselves "How do we organize our code ?".
Well, in programming, we have three ways to do so:

1. OOP
2. Procedural
3. Functional

# OOP

when we decided to code in oop(Objects Oriented Programming), we have to write everything in class
theres classes use properties as attribute and methods to reason about our code.

# Procedural

I believe we all used this way without knowing that its called a procedural. In this way, the code
is executed from top to bottom, our code would as sequential of steps/tasks. Each function represents
a task/step

# Functional

Our code we rely on the pure function with side effect, give it the same inputs, produce the same results.
And we pass data through parameters.
