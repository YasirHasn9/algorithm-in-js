// Frequency Counters
// it is a term in algorithm that is used to describe the method of find an element in array
// or string and then find or collect the frequencies/values of it

// how it works 
// this pattern uses objects or sets to collect the wanted values. By using objects or sets
// that allows us to avoid nested loop or O(n^2) operations with arrays/strings.

// when it useful
// this is useful when you have multiple inputs of data and you need to compare them 
// to see if they consist similar values like anagrams of one another or a value 
// contained of another value


// challenge
/*
Write a function that accepts 2 arrays. The function should written true
if every value in the array has its corresponding value squared 
in the second array.
